# Bellabeat Case Study: Leaf Chakra Analysis
## How Non-Bellabeat Smart Device Trends Can Guide Marketing Strategy

### Project Overview
This project is part of my Google Data Analytics Capstone. I am analyzing FitBit fitness tracker data to identify consumer habits that can help Bellabeat—a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women—refine its marketing strategy.

### 🌿 Primary Focus: Leaf Chakra
While Bellabeat offers several products, this analysis specifically focuses on the **Leaf Chakra**. The Leaf Chakra is a unique wellness tracker that can be worn as a necklace or clip, focusing on tracking activity, sleep, and stress through a nature-inspired design.

###  Business Task
Analyze smart device usage data to understand how consumers are using their wearables, and apply those insights to influence the marketing strategy for the Leaf Chakra.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
* **R (RStudio)** for Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization.
* **Tidyverse, Lubridate, and Ggplot2** packages.
* **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** (via Kaggle).

###  Key Questions
1. What are the current trends in smart device usage?
2. How do these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How can these trends help influence the marketing of the Leaf Chakra?
